# VR-Project-Sweden-Ukraine
Introducing the Unity VR game, where players experience a celebration of Ukrainian culture while navigating disruptive behavior in a peaceful and entertaining manner. In this game, players have two options for handling the situation: using objects found in their environment to playfully "beat" the disruptor or offering gifts like flowers or traditional bread and salt to welcome them into the celebration.

With various activities such as jumping over fire, and searching for a mythical plant in the darkness of the night, players are immersed in the celebration's customs and traditions. 

Through Unity VR technology, players are transported into a world of vibrant colors, traditional music, and interactive gameplay, promoting unity and cultural appreciation. Join the celebration today and experience the best of Ukrainian culture!
